h2. _Cache by Page_

Extension for Radiant CMS which enables per page admin option of setting caching to a non-default value, or turning it off altogether

* Created by:  Andrew vonderLuft
* Contact: avonderluft [at] avlux [dot] net

h3. Revision History

* 1.0 - 4/2009 - Radiant 0.7 compatible, per page caching options

h3. Requirements

* Radiant 0.7 or greater
* no other known dependencies

h3. Installation

From your RADIANT_ROOT:

* <pre>$ script/extension install cache_by_page</pre>
* Restart your radiant app, and you should be good to go.

h3. Page Caching

* Available to admin users only.  You can change this by removing "if current_user.admin?" from the top of the caching_meta template.
* The cache_expire_time is being set with a text field with no validation for a few reasons:
# The time_select in rails has issues when the :include_blank => true option is set, viz. it consistently throws multi-parameter assignment errors.
# At validation time the text entered has already been parsed into a Time object, therefore attempting validates_format_of with a regex for hh:mm is pointless.
# Consequently, if you enter "www" it will parse the input into Time 00:00 (midnight).  To avoid possible confusion, I hare added Current Setting in the meta partial.

* Expire time displays as hh:mm:ss, due to fact that it is a Time object being handled by ActiveRecord, but it is entered as hh:mm, with seconds defaulting to 00.

h3. Acknowledgments

As always, Sean Cribbs lent assistance with the finer points of Ruby, Rails and Radiant.  The _Jupiter_ of Holst is still exquisite, even if it is a little bit of overkill for a podcast.
